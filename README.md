# 🚀 Gen-AI Learning Journey

This repository is part of my **Generative AI journey**, where I practice and share code while exploring different foundations and projects step by step.  
The focus here is on building strong fundamentals first, then gradually moving towards advanced Gen-AI applications.

## 📂 What’s Inside?
This repo contains hands-on implementations, experiments, and projects from my AI learning path.  
Some of the core areas I’m working on:

1. **Foundations & Math Essentials**  
   - Python basics for AI  
   - Numerical computing with NumPy  
   - Data handling with Pandas  
   - Data visualization with Matplotlib  

2. **Machine Learning Essentials**  
   - Train/test splits & evaluation  
   - Loss functions & optimization basics  
   - Overfitting & generalization concepts  

3. **Deep Learning Foundations**  
   - Neural Networks basics  
   - Intro to CNNs, RNNs, and optimizers  
   - Handling text and images as data  

4. **Core GenAI Models (Next Stage)**  
   - Understanding autoencoders & GANs  
   - Playing with simple text/image generation
